# Angular Testing Workshop
For this workshop, we are going to build Jasmine tests around components and NGRX assets.

## Getting Started
```
npm install
npm start
```

This will both boot up a data server on localhost:3000 and serve the frontend on localhost:4200.

## Testing
To run the tests, run npm test.
